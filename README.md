## Gameplay

This is a simple little game for practicing recognizing [killable eye shapes](https://senseis.xmp.net/?KillableEyeShapes).
Determine if each group is dead, alive or unsettled and click the corresponding label.
You have 30 seconds to solve as many positions as you can.

- A black group is dead if white can kill it even if black plays first.
- A black group is alive if black can live even if white plays first.
- A black group is unsettled if black can live playing first, or white could kill playing first.

There are no positions involving direct kos, but [bent four in the corner](https://senseis.xmp.net/?BentFourInTheCorner) is included and counts as dead.
